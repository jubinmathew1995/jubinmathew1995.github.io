Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\u0026#39;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. - It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. socialIcons: - name: email url: \u0026#34;mailto://abc@gmail.com\u0026#34; - name: twitter url: \u0026#34;https://twitter.com/\u0026#34; - name: stackoverflow url: \u0026#34;https://stackoverflow.com\u0026#34; - name: github url: \u0026#34;https://github.com/\u0026#34; - name: gitlab url: \u0026#34;https://gitlab.com/\u0026#34; - name: linkedin url: \u0026#34;https://linkedin.com/\u0026#34; cover: hidden: true # hide everywhere but not in structured data hiddenInList: true # hide on list pages and home hiddenInSingle: true # hide on single page responsiveImages: false # For responsive images menu: main: - identifier: Posts name: Posts url: /posts/ weight: 20 - identifier: tags name: Tags url: /tags/ weight: 20 Local testing using hugo server For local testing of the static site we can use the local server which comes with the Hugo for testing.\nhugo server or hugo server -D Adding a new post to the blog/posts site We can use the new command to create a new post. It will create a new post named my-first-post in the content/posts directory and the new file which is created will have the base template as of default.md archetypes created and updated earlier.\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md Generate the static files for deployment We can use the hugo command for generating/building the static site which can later be used for deployment.\nhugo Please refer the hugo documentation for all the flags and options or refer the man pages for hugo.\nImplementing the CI/CD pipeline for automatic build \u0026amp; deployment We will be using the Github actions to build and deploy the static site in Github pages.\nGenerate Github tokens We need to generate a new personal access token from Github Tokens and use the same token in the repository which will be pushing the static build site for deployment to the external repository. Please refer this site.\nCreate the workflow We need to enable the github actions for automatically deploying the site. We will be deploying the site to an external repository. Please refer actions-gh-pages.\nname: project-build-deployment on: push: branches: [ main ] pull_request: branches: [ main ] workflow_dispatch: jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: repository-checkout uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: update-submodule-theme-repo run: git submodule update --init --recursive - name: install-hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 - name: build-project run: hugo -D --minify - name: deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: personal_token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }} external_repository: XXXXXX/YYYYYYYY publish_dir: ./public user_name: XXXXXX user_email: XXXXXX@XXXXXX.com publish_branch: main Enable the github pages for the external repository Enable the github pages in the /Settings/Pages.\nConclusion We just need to update the markdown files for the new posts and push it.
